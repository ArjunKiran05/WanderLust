# WanderLust

WanderLust is a simple full-stack web application inspired by platforms like Airbnb.  
The goal of this project is to understand and implement the core ideas behind a listing-based platform using the MERN stack, without the complexity of a real-world production system.

This project is built primarily as a learning project to practice full-stack development concepts.

## Project Motivation

The main purpose of building this project was to:
- Strengthen my understanding of the MERN stack
- Learn how frontend and backend communicate in a real application
- Practice structuring a full-stack project
- Get comfortable with authentication, routing, and database integration

This project is not intended to be a production-ready clone of Airbnb, but rather a practical step toward building more complex applications in the future.
